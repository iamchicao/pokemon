Pokedex developed using React and Next.js. I have a list with the first 151 Pokémons. By navigating to each one's page, you will be able to see their status and description.

Using as database [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and also files located in src/data.

_Objectives_:

- [x] You should create a react app that should list the first 151 pokémons with their images and names.
- [x] In this list it should be possible to filter the pokémons by name.
- [x] You don't have to worry about the layout of the application, this is not part of this evaluation.
- [x] Use the base of https://pokeapi.co/ to feed your front with the first 151 pokémons.
- [ ] In the list of pokémons, when you click on a pokémon you must show its evolution (if any) and its type.
